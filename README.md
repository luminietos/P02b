# "What ought to get done?" - JS/jQuery To-Do List (Project 02B)

## Description
This is a jQuery To-Do list I made for my University's JavaScript course. It's based on [my first JS project](https://luminietos.github.io/P01/) (P01), only with the addition of jQuery, a completely different UI and UX. It was created in May 2022.

You can find the site [here](https://luminietos.github.io/P02b/) (GitHub) or [here](https://dynamic-croissant-ae2a30.netlify.app/) (Netlify).

## Step-by-step guide - *"How do I actually use this site?"*
Write an item on the to-do list, and click the "+" -button to add it to the list. Unlike [my first to-do list](https://luminietos.github.io/P01/), refreshing, or closing and re-opening the the page will delete the items, as this was meant to be just a quick way for me to get familiar with jQuery.

Once you've added one or more items, you can click the checkmark button to mark the item you selected as completed, or you can click the skull button will delete it. For the sake of variety, these buttons change color from white to green and red respectively on hover. 

If you wish to delete all of the items on the list at once, you can also click on the moon-shaped button next to the text field. Clicking the button will result in a pop-up message that will inform you of what clicking the button results in, and asks you to confirm that that's what you want to do. 

There's also an info button in the shape of a question mark next to the text-field. This will give the user information on how to use the list. There's also a button that shows and hides the same information on-click. While both of these buttons aren't necessary for the app to work, they were requirements in the assignment instructions for this project, which is why they co-exist.

The list itself adapts and grows as you add more items.

## Status
The development of this project is complete for the foreseeable future.
